RESET:

git reset - Reset to previus commit if a bad file or code has been added to staging area.

git add bad.md
git reset (Will remove bad.md from staging area)

git reset {commit hash} - Soft reset (default behaviour). If a bad commit is made, reset to previous commit using 
the id from log history. This deletes the bad commit from history, but keeps ths changes in staging area as before.

git reset --hard {hash} - Resets to older commit, file changes are gone!

git reset --hard HEAD~1 : Resets to previous commit, all changes are removed.

git reset --mixed HEAD~1 : The commited code in latest commit goes to the working directory, one can update the code 
using the latest commit code

git rest --soft HEAD~1 : The commited code in latest commit goes to the staging area along with the last commit code
One can cherry pick what code to stage and commit.

Similar to reset --hard, but keeps the bad(or unexpected) commit to the commit history.
